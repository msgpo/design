# Toronto Mesh Design

This repository is for all Toronto Mesh related graphic work.  Files are grouped by project.

## File types

Toronto Mesh website code should be directed towards the [tomesh.net](https://github.com/tomeshnet/tomesh.net) repository.

For assets intended to be used by others an open format should be included alongside the original format if possible, this is not a hard rule although it is a hard suggestion and depending on the content and its intended use open formats may be required when submitting new graphics.  For vectors intended for use by others a high quality bitmap should ideally be included.

## Organization

Design work that is currently in use or should be used by others goes into the 'current-assets' directory.  Work that has been depreciated lives in the 'legacy-assets' directory.

Layered graphics formats (AI, SVG, PSD) that are in the 'current-assets' directory and are intended for production use should have some semblance of organized layers.  This is not a requirement of graphics that are currently in development.
